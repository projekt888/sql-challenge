# sql-challenge
For Georgia Tech Data Analytics
There are two sql files.  One creates the SQL databases (for CSV imports).  There are 6 DBs in total.  
The other file containts the queries to show specific questions from the assignment.

There's a text file that's used to build the data diagram, and the data diagram itself.

Lastly, there's the bonus Jupyter Notebook file that performs a sql command, imports it into a pandas dataframe, and plots the result.
